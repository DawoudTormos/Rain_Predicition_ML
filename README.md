# Rain Detection using Machine Learning  

🌧️ **Predict whether it will rain tomorrow using weather data**  

This project implements a **machine learning model** to forecast rainfall based on historical meteorological data. Using daily weather observations (e.g., humidity, cloud cover, past rainfall), the model predicts the likelihood of rain the following day.  

## 📌 Key Features  
- **Classification model** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks)  
- **Dataset**: Publicly available weather data from **Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology**  
- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, feature engineering, and normalization  
- **Evaluation**: Compares model accuracy against traditional forecasting methods  

## 🚀 Applications  
- **Agriculture**: Helps farmers plan irrigation and harvesting  
- **Disaster Management**: Early warning for floods or droughts  
- **Urban Planning**: Improves water resource management  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Atmospheric conditions** (humidity, pressure, temperature)  
- **Cloud cover & wind speed**  
- **Historical rainfall records**
- **other factors**

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rain_detection_ML.git  
   ```  
2. Run the Jupyter notebook for training & evaluation:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook rain_prediction_model.ipynb  
   ```  

## 📊 Results  
- Model achieves **85.54% accuracy** (varies by algorithm)  
- Feature importance analysis reveals key weather indicators  

🤝 **Contributions welcome!** Open to optimizations, new models, or expanded datasets.
