This repository contains a machine learning project for rain prediction using historical meteorological data. The goal is to predict whether it will rain the next day based on weather measurements like atmospheric water vapor, cloud formation, and past rainfall records. The dataset, sourced from Australiaâ€™s Bureau of Meteorology, includes daily weather observations for training the model.

The project explores traditional forecasting methods (e.g., weather models, expert analysis) and compares them with an ML-based approach for improved accuracy. While not perfect, the model reduces reliance on manual prediction, offering a scalable solution for agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning.

Key Features:

Rain prediction using ML (classification)

Public Australian weather dataset

Comparison with traditional forecasting
